# DDD Processing Pipelines

DDD Pipelines allow for a _declarative_ style of processing tasks that pave the way
for posterior extension or modification, and to create different versions of
a generation process.

This can be useful, for example, in order to generate alternative styles
or different levels of detail (LODs).

DDD Pipeline tasks are designed to play together with DDD Selectors to filter
the nodes that each task acts upon.

# DDD Selectors

DDD Selectors are a language to select nodes within a node hierarchy.

DDD Selectors were originally inspired and requested by OSM community in order to mimic
the node selection syntax used by tools like [OverPass](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_turbo/MapCSS).
They have been extended to support tree-like node hierarchies.

Selectors are a building block for [DDD Pipelines](pipelines.md), as they can be used
to select which nodes a pipeline task apply to.
